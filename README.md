# iPadLinux
This is just my development hub where I am putting files I may or may not need.
THIS IS A WIP! DO NOT DOWNLOAD STUFF HERE UNTIL AN ACTUAL RELEASE COMES OUT (If one ever does)
Know anything about iDevice Kernels, Hardware, Boot Process, etc? Wanna chip in some knowledge? PM me with your ideas and I will let you know if you can join the project!
I have an iPad 2,1 (n93ap) for testing purposes, any files you make for this project can be used on your own devices for testing or you can send to me if compiled for my device!
